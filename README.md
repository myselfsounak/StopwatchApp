# Stopwatch App

## Project Description and Features
The Stopwatch App is a simple yet functional application designed to help users track elapsed time accurately. The application features a user-friendly interface and includes the following functionalities:

- **Start, Pause, and Reset**: Users can start the stopwatch, pause it, and reset the timer to zero.
- **Real-Time Display**: The timer updates in real-time, displaying hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features a clean and intuitive layout, making it easy for users to operate.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: The app is designed to run smoothly without excessive resource consumption.

## Technologies Used and Rationale for Choosing Them
- **Kotlin**: Chosen as the programming language due to its modern syntax, safety features, and full interoperability with Java, making it ideal for Android development.
- **Android Studio**: The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development. It provides powerful tools for app development, testing, and debugging.
- **ConstraintLayout**: Utilized for the UI layout, allowing flexible positioning of UI components while optimizing for performance and responsiveness across different device sizes.
- **Android SDK**: The software development kit provided by Google for building Android applications, offering the necessary libraries and tools to create feature-rich apps.

## Challenges Faced and How You Overcame Them
1. **Handling Time Updates**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring the timer updates accurately in real-time without draining device resources.
   - **Solution**: Utilized a `Handler` with a `Runnable` to post updates every 10 milliseconds, ensuring efficient use of system resources while maintaining accuracy.

2. **UI Design**:
   - **Challenge**: Creating a responsive layout that works well on various screen sizes.
   - **Solution**: Employed `ConstraintLayout` for flexible positioning and scaling of UI components, ensuring that the app remains visually appealing on different devices.

3. **Thread Management**:
   - **Challenge**: Managing the lifecycle of the timer when the app is paused or stopped.
   - **Solution**: Implemented checks to start, pause, and reset the timer correctly, ensuring a smooth user experience without memory leaks.

## Future Improvements or Features
- **Lap Functionality**: Add the ability to record lap times, allowing users to track multiple elapsed times within a single session.
- **Sound Notifications**: Implement sound alerts for specific intervals or when the timer reaches a certain value.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Introduce a theme switcher to allow users to toggle between light and dark modes for better accessibility.
- **Save and Load Timers**: Allow users to save their stopwatch sessions and retrieve them later.
- **Customization Options**: Enable users to customize the timer display format and color scheme according to their preferences.
